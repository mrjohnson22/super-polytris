Super Polytris
==============

An ultra-customizable version of Tetris, made in Flash.

Made for www.newgrounds.com:
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/631244?id=631244

Note 1: Other than possible bug fixes, no continued development is planned.

Note 2: Large non-text files (like the main .fla file and sound/music assets) are NOT included, both due to size constraints and because the main purpose of this repo is to share the game's source code for those curious to see it.
